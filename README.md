# Interview Preparation (Data Structures)
This repository consists of the implementation of various probable interview questions as a part of my interview preparation. The sources include Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and some questions from other websites like GeekForGeeks, leetcode, etc

The solutions are presented in Python 3.6.1

The questions range from Array and Strings to linked List. stack and queues for now.
